msgid ""
"You will often distribute long listings over multiple pages.  This is called "
"*pagination* and explained at http://www.qgoda.net/en/docs/pagination/.  The "
"general principle is simple.  Instead of iterating directly ver the list, "
"you feed the set of posts into the Qgoda plug-in function `paginate()`:"
msgstr ""

#: ../en/docs/listings.md:90
msgid ""
"The parameters `start` and `total` are mandatory. The parameter `per_page` "
"defaults to 10 (and could be omitted here).  The method does really not do "
"anything special or things that could not be done in regular Template "
"Toolkit code.  It has the main advantage that all the necessary computations "
"are done in Perl (and therefore faster).  If you dump the result of the "
"function into the rendered page, it should be pretty obvious how to use it "
"for generating a list of links to the individual pages."

msgstr ""

"The method `Qgoda.clone()` has one mandatory named argument, the `location` "
